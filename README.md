# Shuttle

A shuttle bus goes back and forth between two places. 
However, the term is also used more generally for short-haul transport that may be one-way or have multiple stops (including shared ride or loop), particularly for airport buses; compare loose use of limousine.

There are many organizations uses the transport facility for their employee. 
And they have a particular route for this. So, here we are designing a platform to manage the Shuttle Bus Service by a particular organization.
